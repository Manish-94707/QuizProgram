# QuizProgram
QuizQuestion class represents a single question with options and the correct option.
The questions ArrayList contains the list of questions. Add more questions as needed.
startQuiz method displays a question, sets a timer, and waits for user input. It then checks if the answer is correct and increments the score accordingly.
setTimer method schedules a task (closing the question if time is up) after a specified number of seconds.
showResult method displays the final score and any optional summary.
Please note that this is a basic implementation and might need further improvements based on your specific requirements. You can add more questions by extending the questions ArrayList. Additionally, you may want to handle user input validation and edge cases for robustness.
